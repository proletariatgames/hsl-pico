/**
 * A signaler that delays signals, merging signals that are dispatched right after another. If the signaler merges multiple
 * signals, to the outside world, it will be as if only the last signal was dispatched.
 * 
 * This type of signaler is useful if, for instance, you have a slider and you perform some heavy logic whenever the user
 * changes the value of that slider. If the user changes that value a couple of times in one second, you'd want the logic to be
 * performed only once. The merging signaler helps achieve this, by merging the signals dispatched whenever the value changes
 * into one signal.

	 * The passed delay defines how long the signaler waits after the first signal was dispatched before dispatching the merged
	 * signal. Zero (0) is a valid value, passing null or nothing is equivalent to passing zero.
	 * 
	 * If the reject null data flag is set, the signaler will throw an exception if the subject attempts to dispatch a signal
	 * with null as data, or the the signaler is about to bubble a signal that contains null as data.
